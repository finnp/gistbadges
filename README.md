# GistBadges

The goal of this project is to allow GitHub users to easily issue badges hosted
by GitHub Gist. 

It should work something like this:
* Logging in with GitHub
* Uploading image and add Badge data and receiver
* Then the app automatically creates a gist with the appropriate data
* The Issuer gets a link to give it to the receiver
* The link allows the User to add the link to the Back Pack
* Win
